# Welcome, explorer! 🤟

### I'm Siddhant and writing code is my one true love! 💖

### Javascript is where I shine and I'm up for a React / Redux showdown any day.

### I also like working with native code for Android and bash scripts. I love automating everything and I can automate anything with a bash script.

### My code is mostly okay, but sometimes I write infinite loops that bring the entire server infrastructure to its knees. ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯
